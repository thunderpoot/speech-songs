Astlimov's Laws
1: A robot may not give up a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to be given up.
2: A robot must not let down a human being except where such orders would conflict with the First Law, and in which case the third law applies.
3: A robot must never run around and desert a human being as long as such inaction does not conflict with either of the first two laws.
